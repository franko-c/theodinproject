		<h2>HTML Boilerplate</h2>   
		<p>An <strong>HTML boilerplate</strong>, or just a <em>boilerplate</em>, is a block of code, a bit like a template, that is designed to get you up and running with your website, in as little time as possible.</p>

		<p>A boilerplate allows a web developer, no matter their level of experience, to jump right into creating a website, <strong>without the need to worry about the initial setting up of the HTML elements required for a webpage to work</strong>, the following elements are the most often included in a boilerplate:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><em>!DOCTYPE</em></li>
				<li><em>html</em></li>
				<li><em>head</em></li>
				<li><em>body</em></li>
			</ul>

		<p>Generally, in the context of HTML, a boilerplate will, at the very least, include all the necessary tags required for your webpage to pass the <em>W3C validation checks</em>, assuming the additional changes you make are also in line with their standards.</p>

		<h3>Ramblings on Boilerplates</h3>
		<p>HTML has been around long enough that it <em>Just Makes Sense</em> to have a quick, easy, reusable and indeed, customisable way to get a website - as barebones as it may be - up and running.</p>

		<p>It may come as no surprise then, that the concept of a boilerplate <a href="" target="_blank">exists for <strong>CSS</strong> files</a>, too.</p>
		
		<p>The most popular CSS boilerplates come in two flavours, and they are quite different in their approach at providing you with a starting point.</p> 
		
		<h4>CSS Reset</h4>
		<p>
			The original boilerplate, commonly known as a <em>CSS Reset</em>, aims to <strong>remove as much of the default styles applied by the browser</strong> as possible. In practice, this allows, and even demands, that the developer be as explicit as possible in their approach when styling.However, it also means that any default styles that you might have found beneficial, are now gone.
		</p>
		<h4>Normalize.css</h4>
		<p>
			<em>Normalize.css</em> is a CSS library that aims to make the default styling of HTML elements consistent across different web browsers. It does this by:  - <strong>Correcting browser inconsistencies</strong> in how elements are rendered - <strong>Normalizing base styles</strong> like font, line-height, and margins/padding - <strong>Improving accessibility</strong> of elements like links, SVGs, and form controls - <strong>Modernizing defaults</strong> for newer HTML5 elements
